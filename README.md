# Coding-Industrial-Internet-of-Things
**Deloitte Forage**

This repository contains my submission for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. In this program, students are asked to help Daikibo Industrials (a global leader in manufacturing of heavy machinery) with a variety of problems that they are facing.

**Coding**

Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need help to combine the two files.

By completing this task, I learned how to manipulate json files in Python as well as how to use unittest framework to write and run test for a python code.
